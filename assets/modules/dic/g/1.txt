Α<br/>
A<br/>
al'-fah<br/>
Of Hebrew origin; the first letter of the alphabet: figuratively only (from its use as a numeral) the first. Often used (usually “an”, before a vowel) also in composition (as a contraction from <a class="dictionaryRef" onClick="loadDicText(1,427)">G427</a>) in the sense of privation; so in many words beginning with this letter; occasionally in the sense of union (as a contraction of <a class="dictionaryRef" onClick="loadDicText(1,260)">G260<a/>): - Alpha.<br/>
Total KJV occurrences: 4
